                <cmd>Heat a small-to-medium, oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add olive oil and minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes or until just lightly golden brown</cmd>
            </step>
            <step audience="armando">
                <cmd>Transfer garlic to food processor, along with remaining omelet ingredients (tofu – cornstarch) and mix to combine, scraping down sides as needed. Add just a touch of water to thin – 1-2 Tbsp at most. Set aside</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Add the veggies to the skillet. Season with salt and pepper and sauté to desired doneness</cmd>

            <step>
                <cmd>Pour in the omelette batter and cook over medium heat on the stove top for 5 minutes until the edges start to dry.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Place skillet in 375 degree oven and bake until dry and deep golden brown – 10-15 minutes. The longer it bakes the less soft/wet it will be, so if you prefer a more “well done” omelet, cook closer to 15 or more</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Carefully remove from oven with oven mitt and fold over gently with a spatula. If it doesn’t want to fold, you can serve it as a frittata or scramble!</cmd>

               <cmd>Serve with desired toppings and enjoy</cmd>
