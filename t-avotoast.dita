                <cmd>Add the oil to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add in the sliced mushrooms and saut√© for 8-12 minutes or until golden brown, stirring occasionally but not too often</cmd>

                <substep audience="armando">
                    <cmd>Grip the avocado gently on one side with one hand. With a sharp knife, cut the avocado lengthwise around the pit and twist to split the avocado in half</cmd>

                <substep audience="armando">
                    <cmd>Gently tap the pit with a knife with enough force so that the knife edge wedges into the pit, but not so hard as to cut all the way through it</cmd>
